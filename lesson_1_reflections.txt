How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    With the help of diff, I could immediately pin point where I made a mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In the future, I could review how my programme was improved step by step, from which I
    learned about how certain bugs were fixed. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual saving is more flexible than automatical saving while automatical saving can never
    be forgetten.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some updates is related with multiple files while some unpdates only need to be done in
    certain file seperately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By using git log, I could view all commits the author made. By using git diff, it is easy to compare two versions of file.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Even if I made mistakes and damaged something should not be changed, I can easily find back the right version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for Checking update, commiting updates and so on.
